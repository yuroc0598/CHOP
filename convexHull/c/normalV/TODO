implemented the matlab inhull.m, however, inhull itself is not right.

solution:

1. fix inhull?

2. check qhull to give a and N

3. check the tessalation in python, check its dimension


after qhull Fv, I actually get the point index in the facets, translate it to point coordinates by only extract the first column of vertice file, only need one point for each facet
