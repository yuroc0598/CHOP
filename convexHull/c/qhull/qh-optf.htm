<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FO">FO - print list of
selected options </a></h3>

<p>Lists selected options and default values to stderr.
Additional 'FO's are printed to stdout. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FQ">FQ - print command for
qhull and input </a></h3>

<p>Prints qhull and input command, e.g., &quot;rbox 10 s | qhull
FQ&quot;. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fd">Fd - use cdd format for
input </a></h3>

<p>The input starts with comments. The first comment is reported
in the summary. Data starts after a &quot;begin&quot; line. The
next line is the number of points followed by the dimension plus
one and &quot;real&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;. Then the points
are listed with a leading &quot;1&quot; or &quot;1.0&quot;. The
data ends with an &quot;end&quot; line.</p>

<p>For halfspaces ('Fd <a href="qh-opt.htm#Hn">H,n,n,...</a>'),
the input format is the same. Each halfspace starts with its
offset. The sign of the offset is the opposite of Qhull's
convention. The first two lines of the input may be a feasible
point in '<a href="#FV">FV</a>' format.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FD">FD - use cdd format for
normals </a></h3>

<p>Option 'FD' prints normals ('<a href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a>', '<a
href="#Fo">Fo</a>', '<a href="#Fi">Fi</a>') or points ('<a
href="qh-opto.htm#p">p</a>') in cdd format. The first line is the
command line that invoked Qhull. Data starts with a
&quot;begin&quot; line. The next line is the number of normals or
points followed by the dimension plus one and &quot;real&quot;.
Then the normals or points are listed with the offset before the
coefficients. The offset for points is 1.0. The offset for
normals has the opposite sign. The data ends with an
&quot;end&quot; line.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FA">FA - compute total area
and volume for option 's' </a></h3>

<p>With option 'FA', Qhull includes the total area and volume in
the summary ('<a href="qh-opto.htm#s">s</a>'). If facets are
merged, the area and volume are approximations. Option 'FA' is
automatically set for options '<a href="#Fa">Fa </a>', '<a
href="qh-optp.htm#PAn">PAn</a>', and '<a href="qh-optp.htm#PFn">PFn</a>'.
</p>

<p>With options '<a href="qh-optv.htm#d">d</a> <a
href="qh-opto.htm#s">s</a> FA', Qhull computes the total area of
the Delaunay triangulation. This equals the volume of the convex
hull of the data points. With options '<a href="qh-optv.htm#dQu">d
Qu</a> <a href="qh-opto.htm#s">s</a> FA', Qhull computes the
total area of the furthest-site Delaunay triangulation. This
equals of the total area of the Delaunay triangulation. </p>

<p>See '<a href="#Fa">Fa</a>' for further details. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FV">FV - print average
vertex </a></h3>

<p>The average vertex is the average of all vertex coordinates.
It is a feasible point for half-space intersection. The first
line is the dimension and &quot;1&quot;; the second line is the
coordinates. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>qhull <a href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a> FV <a
    href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a> | qhull <a href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a>
    <a href="qh-opt.htm#Hn">H</a> <a href="#Fp">Fp</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>prints the extreme points of the original point set (roundoff
included). </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fs">Fs - print summary</a></h3>

<p>The first line consists of the number of integers
(&quot;7&quot;), followed by the dimension, the number of points,
the number of vertices, the number of facets, the number of
vertices selected for output, the number of facets selected for
output, and the number of coplanar points for selected facets.</p>

<p>The second line consists of the number of reals
(&quot;2&quot;), followed by the maximum offset to an outer plane
and and minimum offset to an inner plane. Roundoff is included.</p>

<p>Later versions of Qhull may produce additional integers or
reals.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FS">FS - print sizes</a></h3>

<p>The first line consists of the number of integers
(&quot;0&quot;). The second line consists of the number of reals
(&quot;2&quot;), followed by the total facet area, and the total
volume. Later versions of Qhull may produce additional integers
or reals.</p>

<p>The total volume measures the volume of the intersection of
the halfspaces defined by each facet. It is computed from the
facet area. Both area and volume are approximations for
non-simplicial facets. See option '<a href="#Fa">Fa </a>' for
further notes. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Ft">Ft - print triangulation</a></h3>

<p>Prints a triangulation with added points for non-simplicial
facets. The first line is the dimension and the second line is
the number of points, the number of facets, and the number of
ridges. The points follow, one per line, then the facets follow
as a list of point indices preceded by the number of points. The
simplicies are oriented. For convex hulls with simplicial facets,
the output is the same as option '<a href="qh-opto.htm#o">o</a>'.</p>

<p>The added points are the centrums of the non-simplicial
facets. Except for large facets, the centrum is the average
vertex coordinate projected to the facet's hyperplane. Large
facets may use an old centrum to avoid recomputing the centrum
after each merge. In either case, the centrum is clearly below
neighboring facets. See <a href="qh-impre.htm">Precision issues</a>.
</p>

<p>The new simplicies will not be clearly convex with their
neighbors and they will not satisfy the Delaunay property. They
may even have a flipped orientation. </p>

<p>If you add a point-at-infinity with '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qz">Qz</a>',
it is printed after the input sites and before any centrums. It
will not be used in a Delaunay facet.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fv">Fv - print vertices for
each facet </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the number of facets. Then each facet is
printed, one per line. Each line is the number of vertices
followed by the corresponding point ids. Vertices are listed in
the order they were added to the hull (the last one added is the
first listed). Similar to option '<a href="qh-opto.htm#i">i</a>'.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fc">Fc - print coplanar
points for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The output starts with the number of facets. Then each facet
is printed one per line. Each line is the number of coplanar
points followed by the point ids. Option '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qi">Qi</a>' includes the interior points. Each
coplanar point or interior point is assigned to the facet it is
furthest above (resp., least below). </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FP">FP - print nearest
vertex for coplanar points </a></h3>

<p>The output starts with the number of coplanar points. Then
each coplanar point is printed one per line. Each line is the
point id of the closest vertex, the point id of the coplanar
point, the corresponding facet id, and the distance. Sort the
lines to list the coplanar points nearest to each vertex. </p>

<p>Qhull warns if neither '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qc">Qc</a>' nor '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qi">Qi</a> is selected. The later option lists
interior points. </p>

<p>For Delaunay triangulations ('<a href="qh-optv.htm#d">d</a>'
or '<a href="qh-optv.htm#v">v</a>'), a coplanar point is nearly
incident to a vertex. The distance is the distance in the
original point set.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fn">Fn - print neighboring
facets for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The output starts with the number of facets. Then each facet
is printed one per line. Each line is the number of neighbors
followed by an index for each neighbor. The indices match the
other facet output formats.</p>

<p>A negative index indicates an unprinted facet due to printing
only good facets ('<a href="qh-optp.htm#Pg">Pg</a>', '<a
href="qh-optv.htm#d">d</a>', '<a href="qh-optv.htm#v">v</a>'). It
is the negation of the facet's id (option '<a href="#FI">FI</a>').
For example, negative indices are used for facets &quot;at
infinity&quot; in the Delaunay triangulation.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FN">FN - print neighboring
facets for each point </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the number of points. Then each point is
printed, one per line. For unassigned points (either interior or
coplanar), the line is &quot;0&quot;. For assigned coplanar
points ('<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qc">Qc</a>'), the line is
&quot;1&quot; followed by the index of the facet that is furthest
below the point. For assigned interior points ('<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qi">Qi</a>'), the line is &quot;1&quot;
followed by the index of the facet that is least above the point.
For vertices that do not belong to good facet, the line is
&quot;0&quot;</p>

<p>For vertices of good facets, the line is the number of
neighboring facets followed by the facet indices. The indices
correspond to the other '<a href="#format">F</a>' formats. In 4-d
and higher, the facets are sorted by index. In 3-d, the facets
are in adjacency order (not oriented).</p>

<p>A negative index indicates an unprinted facet due to printing
only good facets ('<a href="qh-optv.htm#d">d</a>', '<a
href="qh-optv.htm#v">v</a>', '<a href="qh-optp.htm#Pdk">Pdk</a>',
'<a href="qh-optp.htm#Pg">Pg</a>'). It is the negation of the
facet's id ('<a href="#FI"> FI</a>'). For example, negative
indices are used for facets &quot;at infinity&quot; in the
Delaunay triangulation.</p>

<p>For Voronoi vertices, option 'FN' lists the Voronoi vertices
for each input site. It corresponds to the second half of option
'<a href="qh-opto.htm#o">o</a>'. To convert from 'FN' to '<a
href="qh-opto.htm#o">o</a>', replace negative indices with zero
and increment non-negative indices by one. </p>

<p>If you are using the <a href="qh-man.htm#library">Qhull
library</a>, option 'FN' has the side effect of reordering the
neighbors for a vertex </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FI">FI - print id for each
facet </a></h3>

<p>Print facet identifiers. These are used internally and listed
with options '<a href="qh-opto.htm#f">f</a>' and '<a href="#FF">FF</a>'.
Options '<a href="#Fn">Fn </a>' and '<a href="#FN">FN</a>' use
facet identifiers for negative indices. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FC">FC - print centrum or
Voronoi vertex for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The output starts with the dimension followed by the number of
facets. Then each facet centrum is printed, one per line. For
option '<a href="qh-optv.htm#v">v </a>', Voronoi vertices are
printed instead. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fp">Fp - print points at
halfspace intersections</a></h3>

<p>The first line is the number of intersection points. The
remainder is one intersection point per line. A intersection
point is the intersection of <i>d</i> or more halfspaces from
option '<a href="qh-opt.htm#Hn">Hn,...</a>'. It corresponds to a
facet of the dual polytope. The &quot;infinity&quot; point
[-10.101,-10.101,...] indicates an unbounded intersection.</p>

<p>If [x,y,z] are the dual facet's normal coefficients and <i>b&lt;0</i>
is its offset, the halfspace intersection occurs at
[x/-b,y/-b,z/-b] plus the interior point. If <i>b&gt;=0</i>, the
halfspace intersection is unbounded. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fo">Fo - print outer planes
for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the dimension plus one. The second line is
the number of facets. The remainder is one outer plane per line.
The format is the same as option '<a href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a>'.</p>

<p>The outer plane is a plane that is above all points. It is an
offset from the facet's hyperplane. It includes a roundoff error
for computing the point distance. When testing the outer plane
(e.g., '<a href="qh-optt.htm#Tv">Tv</a>'), another roundoff error
should be added for the tested point.</p>

<p>If outer planes are not checked ('<a href="qh-optq.htm#Q5">Q5</a>')
or not computed (!qh_MAXoutside), the maximum, computed outside
distance is used instead. This can be much larger than the actual
outer planes.</p>

<p>Note that the outer planes for Geomview output ('<a
href="qh-optg.htm#G">G</a>') include an additional offset for
vertex/point visualization, 'lines closer,' and roundoff error.</p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fi">Fi - print inner planes
for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the dimension plus one. The second line is
the number of facets. The remainder is one inner plane per line.
The format is the same as option '<a href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a>'.</p>

<p>The inner plane is a plane that is below the facet's vertices.
It is an offset from the facet's hyperplane. It includes a
roundoff error for computing the vertex distance.</p>

<p>Note that the inner planes for Geomview output ('<a
href="qh-optg.htm#Gi">Gi</a>') include an additional offset for
vertex visualization and roundoff error. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fa">Fa - print area for each
facet </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the number of facets. The remaining lines
are the area for each facet, one facet per line. See '<a
href="#FA">FA</a>' for computing the total area and volume.</p>

<p>Use '<a href="qh-optp.htm#PAn">PAn</a>' for printing the n
largest facets. Use option '<a href="qh-optp.htm#PFn">PFn</a>'
for printing facets larger than <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>For Delaunay triangulations, the area is the area of each
Delaunay triangle. For Voronoi vertices, the area is the area of
the dual facet to each vertex. With options '<a
href="qh-optv.htm#dQu">d Qu</a> Fa', Qhull computes the areas of
furthest-site Delaunay triangles. </p>

<p>Qhull uses the centrum and ridges to triangulate
non-simplicial facets. The area for non-simplicial facets is the
sum of the areas for each triangle. It is an approximation of the
actual area. The ridge's vertices are projected to the facet's
hyperplane. If a vertex is far below a facet (qh_WIDEcoplanar in <tt>user.h</tt>),
the corresponding triangles are ignored.</p>

<p>For non-simplicial facets, vertices are often below the
facet's hyperplane. If so, the approximation is less than the
actual value and it may be significantly less. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="Fm">Fm - print merge count
for each facet </a></h3>

<p>The first line is the number of facets. The remainder is the
number of merges for each facet, one per line. At most 511 merges
are reported for a facet. See '<a href="qh-optp.htm#PMn">PMn</a>'
for printing the facets with the most merges. </p>

<h3><a href="#format"></a><a name="FF">FF - print facets w/o
ridges </a></h3>

<p>Option 'FF' prints all fields of all facets (as in '<a
href="qh-opto.htm#f">f</a>') without printing the ridges. This is
useful in higher dimensions where a facet may have many ridges.
For simplicial facets, options 'FF' and '<a href="qh-opto.htm#f">f
</a>' are equivalent.</p>
