1mNAME0m
       rbox - generate point distributions for qhull

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       Command "rbox" (w/o arguments) lists the options.

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       rbox generates random or regular points according to the options given,
       and outputs the points to stdout. The points are generated in  a	 cube,
       unless  's'  or given. The format of the output is the following: first
       line contains the dimension and a comment,  second  line	 contains  the
       number of points, and the following lines contain the points, one point
       per line. Points are represented by their coordinate values.

1mOPTIONS0m
       n      number of points

       Dn     dimension n-d (default 3-d)

       Bn     bounding box coordinates (default 0.5)

       l      spiral distribution, available only in 3-d

       Ln     lens distribution of radius n.  May be used with 's', 'r',  'G',
	      and 'W'.

       s      cospherical points randomly generated in a cube and projected to
	      the unit sphere

       Wn     restrict points to distance n of the surface of a	 sphere	 or  a
	      cube

       c      add a unit cube to the output

       c Gm   add a cube with all combinations of +m and -m to the output

       d      add a unit diamond to the output.

       d Gm   add a diamond made of 0, +m and -m to the output

       Pn,m,r add  point  [n,m,r]  to  the output first.  Pad coordinates with
	      0.0.

       n      Remove the command line from the first line of output.

       t      use time in seconds as the random number seed (default  is  com‚Äê
	      mand line).

       tn     set the random number seed to n.

       z      generate	integer	 coordinates.	Use  'Bn' to change the range.
	      The default is 'B1e6' for six-digit coordinates.	In R^4, seven-
	      digit coordinates will overflow hyperplane normalization.

       Zn s   restrict	points	to  a  disk  about  the z+ axis and the sphere
	      (default Z1.0).  Includes the opposite pole.  'Z1e-6'  generates
	      degenerate points under single precision.

       Zn Gm s
	      same as Zn with an empty center (default G0.5).

       r s D2 generate a regular polygon

       r s Z1 G0.1
	      generate a regular cone

1mBUGS0m
       Some combinations of arguments generate odd results.
