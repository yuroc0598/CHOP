<p>This section of the Qhull manual discusses the problems caused
by coplanar points and why Qhull uses options '<a
href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a>' or '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>'
by default. If you ignore precision issues with option '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Q0">Q0</a>', the output from Qhull can be
arbitrarily bad.</p>

<p>Use option '<a href="qh-optt.htm#Tv">Tv</a>' to verify the
output from Qhull. It verifies that adjacent facets are clearly
convex. It verifies that all points are on or below all facets. </p>

<p>Qhull automatically tests for convexity if it detects
precision errors while constructing the hull. </p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="prec">Precision
problems</a></h2>

<p>Since Qhull uses floating point arithmetic, roundoff error
occurs with each calculation. This causes problems for most
geometric algorithms. Other floating point codes for convex
hulls, Delaunay triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams also suffer
from these problems. </p>

<p>There are several kinds of precision errors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Representation error occurs when there are not enough
        digits to represent a number, e.g., 1/3.</li>
    <li>Measurement error occurs when the input coordinates are
        from measurements. </li>
    <li>Roundoff error occurs when a calculation is rounded to a
        fixed number of digits, e.g., for a floating point
        calculation.</li>
    <li>Approximation error occurs when the user wants an
        approximate result because the exact result contains too
        much detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under imprecision, calculations may return erroneous results.
For example, roundoff error can turn a small, positive number
into a small, negative number. See Milenkovic [<a
href="qh-man.htm#mile93">'93</a>] for a discussion of <em>strict
robust geometry</em>. Qhull does not meet Milenkovic's criterion
for accuracy. Qhull's error bound is empirical instead of
theoritical.</p>

<p>Qhull 1.0 checked for precision errors but did not handle
them. The output could contain concave facets, facets with
inverted orientation (&quot;flipped&quot; facets), more than two
facets adjacent to a ridge, and two facets with exactly the same
set of vertices.</p>

<p>Qhull 2.4 and later automatically handles errors due to
machine round-off. Option '<a href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a>' or '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>' is set by default. In 5-d and
higher, the output is clearly convex but an input point could be
outside of the hull. This is corrected by using option '<a
href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a>', but then the output may contain
wide facets.</p>

<p>By handling round-off errors, Qhull can provide a variety of
output formats. For example, it can return the halfspace that
defines each facet ('<a href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a>'). The
halfspaces include roundoff error. If the halfspaces were exact,
their intersection would return the original extreme points. If
exact arithmetic was used to intersect the halfspaces, nearly
incident points may be returned for one of the original extreme
point. By handling roundoff error, Qhull returns one intersection
point for each of the original extreme points. Qhull may split or
merge an extreme point, but this appears to be unlikely.</p>

<p>The following pipe is the identity function for Qhull:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>qhull <a href="qh-optf.htm#FV">FV</a> <a
    href="qh-opto.htm#n">n</a> | qhull <a href="qh-opt.htm#Hn">H</a>
    <a href="qh-optf.htm#Fp">Fp</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="limit">Limitations</a></h2>

<p>If one coordinate has a larger absolute value than other
coordinates, it may dominate the effect of roundoff errors on
distance computations. You may use option '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#QbB">QbB</a>' to scale points to the unit cube.
For Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi regions, you may use
option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qbb">Qbb</a>' to scale the last
coordinate to [0,m] where <i>m</i> is the maximum absolute value
of the other coordinates. Option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qbb">Qbb</a>'
is recommended for Delaunay triangulations of integer coordinates
and for the furthest-site Delaunay triangulation ('<a
href="qh-optv.htm#dQu">d Qu</a>') of nearly cocircular points. </p>

<p>Qhull computes the maximum roundoff error from the maximum
coordinates of the point set. Usually the maximum roundoff error
is a reasonable choice for all distance computations. The maximum
roundoff error could be computed separately for each point or for
each distance computation. This is expensive and it conflicts
with option '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn">C-n</a>'. </p>

<p>In 5-d and higher, option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>'
(default) delays merging of coplanar facets until post-merging.
This may allow &quot;dents&quot; to occur in the intermediate
convex hulls. A point may be poorly partitioned and force a poor
approximation. See option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>' for
further discussion.</p>

<p>Option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qc">Qc</a>' is determined by
qh_check_maxout() after constructing the hull. Qhull needs to
retain all possible coplanar points in the facets' coplanar sets.
This depends on qh_RATIOnearInside in <tt>user.h.</tt>
Furthermore, the cutoff for a coplanar point is arbitrarily set
at the minimum vertex. If coplanar points are important to your
application, remove the interior points by hand (set '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qc">Qc</a> <a href="qh-optq.htm#Qi">Qi</a>') or
make qh_RATIOnearInside sufficiently large.</p>

<p>In 3-d, a narrow distribution may result in a poor
approximation. For example, <tt>rbox s 5000 W1e-13 D2 | qhull d
Qu</tt> produces a poor approximation. This is the furthest-site
Delaunay triangulation of nearly cocircular points. During
construction of the hull, a coplanar point is just above two
facets with opposite orientations. These facets span the input
set and the coplanar point is distant for the precise convex
hull. One of the facets is replaced with a facet of the opposite
orientation. This places the coplanar point clearly above the new
facet. To fix this problem, add option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qbb">Qbb</a>'
(it scales the last coordinate). </p>

<p>Qhull generates a warning if the initial simplex is narrow.
For narrow distributions, Qhull changes how it processes coplanar
points -- it does not make a point coplanar until the hull is
finished. If a precision problem occurs under facet merging,
Qhull will report a wide facet (i.e., a large maximum distance
for a point above a facet). This is unlikely for most
distributions. You may turn off the warning message by reducing
qh_WARNnarrow in <tt>user.h</tt>. </p>

<p>Qhull reports an error if there are <em>d+1</em> facets left
and two of the facets are not clearly convex. This typically
occurs when the convexity constraints are too strong or the input
points are degenerate. The former is more likely in 5-d and
higher -- especially with option '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn">C-n</a>'.</p>

<p>Qhull reports the maximum outer plane and inner planes (if
more than roundoff error apart). We do not know an upper bound
for either figure. This is an area for further research. Qhull
does a good job of post-merging in all dimensions. Qhull does a
good job of pre-merging in 2-d, 3-d, and 4-d. With the '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>' option, it does a good job in
higher dimensions. In 5-d and higher, Qhull does poorly at
detecting redundant vertices. </p>

<p>In the summary ('<a href="qh-opto.htm#s">s</a>'), look at the
ratio between the maximum facet width and the maximum width of a
single merge, e.g., &quot;(3.4x)&quot;. Qhull usually reports a
ratio of four or lower in 3-d and six or lower in 4-d. If it
reports a ratio greater than 10, this probably indicates an
implementation error. </p>

<p>It is possible for a zero-area facet to be convex with its
neighbors. This can occur if the hyperplanes of neighboring
facets are above the facet's centrum, and the facet's hyperplane
is above the neighboring centrums. Qhull computes the facet's
hyperplane so that it passes through the facet's vertices. The
vertices can be collinear. </p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="exact">Exact
arithmetic</a></h2>

<p>Exact arithmetic may be used instead of floating point.
Singularities such as coplanar points can either be handled
directly or the input can be symbolically perturbed. Using exact
arithmetic is slower than using floating point arithmetic and the
output may take more space. Chaining a sequence of operations
increases the time and space required. Some operations are
difficult to do; for example, computing the hyperplane through <i>d</i>
points.</p>

<p>Clarkson's <a
href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/voronoi/hull.html">hull
program</a> and Shewchuk's <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html">triangle
program</a> are practical implementations of exact arithmetic.</p>

<p>Clarkson limits the input precision to about fifteen digits.
This reduces the number of nearly singular computations. When a
determinant is nearly singular, he uses exact arithmetic to
compute a precise result.</p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="delaunay">Delaunay
triangulations </a></h2>

<p>Programs that use Delaunay triangulations traditionally assume
a triangulated input. Since Qhull handles imprecision by merging
facets, its output is not triangulated. Instead it produces a
single facet for cocircular points. See option '<a
href="qh-optv.htm#d">d</a>'.</p>

<p>Option '<a href="qh-optf.htm#Ft">Ft</a>' adds points to
triangulate non-simplicial facets. The points are the facets'
centrums. Except for large facets, the centrum is the arithmetic
average of the vertices projected to the facet's hyperplane. The
triangles are not clearly convex with their neighbors. Some
triangles may have flipped orientation.</p>

<p>Try option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qbb">Qbb</a>' with Delaunay
triangulations. It scales the last coordinate and may reduce
roundoff error. </p>

<p>If you must triangulate the original point set, try options '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Q0">Q0</a> <a href="qh-optp.htm#Po">Po</a>'.
They will force a triangulated output if possible. Qhull checks
the output for convexity and reports any problems. A better
solution is to use exact arithmetic -- see above for Clarkson's
or Shewchuk's programs.</p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="imprecise">Imprecise
convex hulls </a></h2>

<p>Qhull handles precision problems by merging non-convex facets.
The result of merging two facets is a thick facet defined by an <i>inner
plane</i> and an <i>outer plane</i>. The inner and outer planes
are offsets from the facet's hyperplane. The inner plane is
clearly below the facet's vertices while the outer plane is
clearly above all input points. Any exact convex hull must lie
between the inner and outer plane.</p>

<p>Qhull tests for convexity by computing a point for each facet.
This point is called the facet's <i>centrum</i>. It is the
arithmetic center of the facet's vertices projected to the
facet's hyperplane. For simplicial facets with <em>d</em>
vertices, the centrum is equivalent to the centroid or center of
gravity. </p>

<p>Two neighboring facets are convex if each centrum is clearly
below the other hyperplane. The '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn2">Cn</a>'
or '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn">C-n</a>' options sets the centrum's
radius to <i>n </i>. A centrum is clearly below a hyperplane if
the computed distance from the centrum to the hyperplane is
greater than the centrum's radius plus two maximum roundoff
errors. Two are required because the centrum can be the maximum
roundoff error above its hyperplane and the distance computation
can be high by the maximum roundoff error.</p>

<p>With the '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn">C-n</a>' or '<a
href="qh-optc.htm#An">A-n </a>' options, Qhull merges non-convex
facets while constructing the hull. The remaining facets are
clearly convex. With the '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx </a>'
option, Qhull merges coplanar facets after constructing the hull.
While constructing the hull, it merges coplanar horizon facets,
flipped facets, concave facets and duplicated ridges. With '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>', coplanar points may be missed, but
it appears to be unlikely.</p>

<p>If the user sets the '<a href="qh-optc.htm#An2">An</a>' or '<a
href="qh-optc.htm#An">A-n</a>' option, then all neighboring
facets are clearly convex and the maximum (exact) cosine of an
angle is <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>If '<a href="qh-optc.htm#C0">C-0</a>' or '<a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>' is used without other precision
options (default), Qhull tests vertices instead of centrums for
adjacent simplicies. In 3-d, if simplex <i>abc</i> is adjacent to
simplex <i>bcd</i>, Qhull tests that vertex <i>a</i> is clearly
below simplex <i>bcd </i>, and vertex <i>d</i> is clearly below
simplex <i>abc</i>. When building the hull, Qhull tests vertices
if the horizon is simplicial and no merges occur. </p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="how">How Qhull
merges facets</a></h2>

<p>If two facets are not clearly convex, then Qhull removes one
or the other facet by merging the facet into a neighbor. It
selects the merge which minimizes the distance from the
neighboring hyperplane to the facet's vertices. Qhull also
performs merges when a facet has fewer than d neighbors (called a
degenerate facet), when a facet's vertices are included in a
neighboring facet's vertices (called a redundant facet), when a
facet's orientation is flipped, or when a ridge occurs between
more than two facets.</p>

<p>Qhull performs merges in a series of passes sorted by merge
angle. Each pass merges those facets which haven't already been
merged in that pass. After a pass, Qhull checks for redundant
vertices. For example, if a vertex has only two neighbors in 3-d,
the vertex is redundant and Qhull merges it into an adjacent
vertex.</p>

<p>Merging two simplicial facets creates a non-simplicial facet
of <em>d+1</em> vertices. Additional merges create larger facets.
When merging facet A into facet B, Qhull retains facet B's
hyperplane. It merges the vertices, neighbors, and ridges of both
facets. It recomputes the centrum if a wide merge has not
occurred (qh_WIDEcoplanar) and the number of extra vertices is
smaller than a constant (qh_MAXnewcentrum).</p>

<h2><a href="qh-impre.htm#TOC"></a><a name="approximate">Approximating
a convex hull</a></h2>

<p>Qhull may be used for approximating a convex hull. This is
particularly valuable in 5-d and higher where hulls can be
immense. You can use '<a href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a> <a
href="qh-optc.htm#Cn">C-n</a>' to merge facets as the hull is
being constructed. Then use '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Cn2">Cn</a>'
and/or '<a href="qh-optc.htm#An2">An</a>' to merge small facets
during post-processing. You can print the <i>n</i> largest facets
with option '<a href="qh-optp.htm#PAn">PAn</a>'. You can print
facets whose area is at least <i>n</i> with option '<a
href="qh-optp.htm#PFn">PFn</a>'. You can output the outer planes
and a feasible point with '<a href="qh-optf.htm#FV">FV</a> <a
href="qh-optf.htm#Fo">Fo</a>' and then compute their intersection
with 'qhull <a href="qh-opt.htm#Hn">Hn</a> <a
href="qh-optq.htm#Qx">Qx</a>'. </p>

<p>To approximate a convex hull in 6-d and higher, use
post-merging with '<a href="qh-optc.htm#Wn">Wn</a>' (e.g., qhull
W1e-1 C1e-2 TF2000). Pre-merging with a convexity constraint
(e.g., qhull Qx C-1e-2) often produces a poor approximation or
terminates with a simplex. Option '<a href="qh-optq.htm#QbB">QbB</a>'
may help to spread out the data.</p>

<p>You will need to experiment to determine a satisfactory set of
options. Use <a href="qh-rbox.htm">rbox</a> to generate test sets
quickly and <a href="qh-man.htm#geomview">Geomview</a> to view
the results.</p>
